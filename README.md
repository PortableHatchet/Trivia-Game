# Overview

This is a basic trivia app that asks how many questions you would like and then through a button click, it proceeds to the first question. The program waits for your next button click to show you the answer and then another click to move on the next question. This happens untill all questions have been asked. 

The main purpose of this project was to practice writing in python as well as implementing a GUI. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

The main tool used to make this work is the website opentdb.com (Open Trivia Database). This allowed free API use and access to a large database of questions for free as well. 

This app is written in python with the GUI created using the TKinter library.
